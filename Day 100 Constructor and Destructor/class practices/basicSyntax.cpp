Constructor and Destructor in C++
=================================

Question:

How to implement a constructor and destructor in C++?


What is Constructor?
----------------------
- A constructor is a special member function of a class that invokes automatically when a object is created. 
- It is used to initialize objects of that class.
- A Constructor does not have any return type, please don't write even void.
- A Constructor has the same name as the class.
- A Constructor can have parameters or not.

There are two type of Constructor:-
-------------------------------------
1). Parameterized Constructor
2). Non-Parameterized Construtor


1). Parameterized Constructor
================================
A Constructor which have parameter is known as parameterized constructor.
- It is used to initialize objects of that class with some values.

2). Non- Parameterized Constructor
- It does not have any parameter.
- It is used to initialize objects of that class with default values.

Note: 
---------
- When no constructor is defined, compiler will called the default construtor automatically.
- If we write our own constructor the default will gonna remove, and our constructor will used here.
