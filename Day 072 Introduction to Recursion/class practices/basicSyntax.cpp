Recursion:-
============

- A Function which calls itself again and again is known as recursive function, and that process called recursion.
- Untill the specific condition met.




Note:- 
- The base case is the condition that stops the recursion.
- The recursive case is the condition that calls the function again.
- The recursive case must be smaller than the original problem.


Points:-
---------
- Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems that have a recursive structure.
- Recursion can be used to solve problems that have a clear base case and a recursive case.
- Recursion can be used to solve problems that have a clear recursive structure.


Recusion said that,
===================
- If you have a large | huge problem then break them into sub-problems.
- If you are able to solve one of them then remaining problem will gonna solve itself.
